## Challenges of Software Development Estimation

Software development is a complex process where many unpredictable factors can influence the duration of a task. Complex dependencies and evolving requirements make accurate estimation difficult. Experienced developers tend to anticipate difficulties better, while juniors may underestimate the effort required. Using similar project histories can improve the quality of estimates. We can also note that customer requirements often change during the course of a project, which can make initial estimates obsolete.

## Planning Poker Technique

An estimation is rarely right, this is why in our project we mainly use the planning poker technique. This technique is based on the consensus-driven estimation process, where team members assign effort points to tasks using a deck of cards with predefined values (e.g., Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.).

Each participant selects a card representing their estimate privately, and then all estimates are revealed simultaneously. If there are significant discrepancies, team members discuss their reasoning before re-estimating until a consensus is reached. This technique helps to mitigate individual biases, encourages discussion, and provides a more accurate estimate by leveraging collective intelligence.

## Complementary Estimation Techniques

Additionally, we complement planning poker with techniques like t-shirt sizing for quick rough estimates and breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones to refine accuracy. Regular review and reassessment of estimates ensure that we adapt to new information and changing project conditions effectively.

## Best Practices for Improving Estimates

A good practice to estimate well a task is to imply every developer, because each of them will be able to talk about their previous experience and it is also a great way for the senior to share their experience with the junior dev.To be as precise as possible, we also keep every past estimation on our planning tool, Jira. This allows us to refine future predictions by identifying recurring patterns and errors.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, although the estimation of software development tasks is rarely accurate, the use of proven methods, team collaboration, and analysis of past errors can be used to gradually improve the accuracy of forecasts and optimize software project management.
