# üìò Project Handbook

This handbook serves as a concise guide for developers and teams working with GitHub in a collaborative software development environment. It outlines practical approaches and standardized workflows for **estimating tasks using SCRUM**, **conducting effective code reviews**, and **managing pull requests** with clarity and efficiency.

## üóÇ Table of Contents
Each section below delves into a key aspect of collaborative development:
1. [Task Estimation in SCRUM](./handbook-scrum.md)
2. [Code Reviews](./handbook-code-reviews.md)
3. [Pull Requests](./handbook-pull-requests.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Plan

The following plan details how contributions are distributed among team members and tracks the progress of each section of the handbook.\
The goal is to create a set of best practices for software development for the following topics:
- **Pull Requests**
- **Code Reviews**
- **SCRUM task estimation**

### Responsabilities

#### **Paul**:
- [x] Setup the GitHub Repository
- [x] Write about Pull Requests best practices
- [ ] Write about Code Reviews best practices
- [x] Organise the post-mortem

#### **Cl√©ment**:
- [x] Write about SCRUM estimation best practices
- [ ] Create Pull Requests schema
- [ ] Create Code Reviews schema
- [ ] Participate in the post-mortem

## Post-mortem

We are satisfied with how the handbook turned out. However, there are some things we could have done differently:
- Streamline the tasks between group members using **GitHub Issues**.
